<h1>what is hacking?</h1>
<font size="4"><p align="center">
Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems or networks to exploit its weaknesses to gain access. Example of Hacking:
 Using password cracking algorithm to gain access to a system 
Computers have become mandatory to run a successful businesses. It is not enough to have isolated computers systems;
 they need to be networked to facilitate communication with external businesses. This exposes them to the outside world 
and hacking. Hacking means using computers to commit fraudulent acts such as fraud, privacy invasion, stealing
corporate/personal data, etc. Cyber crimes cost many organizations millions of dollars every year. Businesses need to protect themselves against such attacks.<p></font>

<font size="4"><p>Before we go any further, let’s look at some of the most commonly used terminologies in the world of hacking. </p>
<font size="12"><p><b>Who is a Hacker? Types of Hackers</b></p></font>

<font size="4"><p>
A Hacker is a person who finds and exploits the weakness in computer systems and/or networks to gain access. Hackers are usually skilled computer programmers with knowledge of computer security. 
Hackers are classified according to the intent of their actions. The following list classifies hackers according to their intent. </P></font>

<tr>
<td><img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\i.png">
<td>Ethical Hacker (White hat): A hacker who gains access to systems with a view to fix the identified weaknesses. They may also perform penetration Testing and vulnerability assessments.</td>

<div "color:#e0e4e5"><tr>
<td><img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\j.jpg"></td>
<td>Cracker (Black hat): A hacker who gains unauthorized access to computer systems for personal gain. The intent is usually to steal corporate data, violate privacy rights, transfer funds from bank accounts etc.</td>

</tr></div>
<tr>
<td><img src="C:\Users\user\Desktop\k.jpg"></td>
<td>Grey hat: A hacker who is in between ethical and black hat hackers. He/she breaks into computer systems without authority with a view to identify weaknesses and reveal them to the system owner.</td>

<h1>What is Cybercrime?</h1>
<font size="4"><p>Cyber crime is the use of computers and networks to perform illegal activities such as spreading computer viruses, online bullying, performing unauthorized electronic fund transfers, etc. Most cybercrimes are committed through the internet. Some cybercrimes can also be carried out using Mobile phones via SMS and online chatting applications.</p></font>


<h1>Type of Cybercrime</h1>
<font size="4"><ul type="square">
<li>The following list presents the common types of cybercrimes:</li><BR>
<li>Computer Fraud: Intentional deception for personal gain via the use of computer systems.</li><BR>
<li>Privacy violation: Exposing personal information such as email addresses, phone number, account details, etc. on social media, websites, etc.</li><BR>
<li>Identity Theft: Stealing personal information from somebody and impersonating that person.</li><BR>
<li>Sharing copyrighted files/information: This involves distributing copyright protected files such as eBooks and computer programs etc.</li><BR>
<li>Electronic funds transfer: This involves gaining an un-authorized access to bank computer networks and making illegal fund transfers.</li><BR>
<li>Electronic money laundering: This involves the use of the computer to launder money.</li><BR>
<li>ATM Fraud: This involves intercepting ATM card details such as account number and PIN numbers. These details are then used to withdraw funds from the intercepted accounts.</li><BR>
<li>Denial of Service Attacks: This involves the use of computers in multiple locations to attack servers with a view of shutting them down.</li><BR>
<li>Spam: Sending unauthorized emails. These emails usually contain advertisements.</li></ul></font>


<h1>What is Ethical Hacking?</h1>
<font size="4"><p>Ethical Hacking is identifying weakness in computer systems and/or computer networks and coming with countermeasures that protect the weaknesses. Ethical hackers must abide by the following rules.</p><font>


<ul>
<font size="4"><li>Get written permission from the owner of the computer system and/or computer network before hacking.</li><BR>
<li>Protect the privacy of the organization been hacked.</li><BR>
<li>Transparently report all the identified weaknesses in the computer system to the organization.</li><BR>
<li>Inform hardware and software vendors of the identified weaknesses.</li><BR>
</ul><font>


<h1>Why Ethical Hacking?</h1>
<font size="4"><u1>
<li>Information is one of the most valuable assets of an organization. Keeping information secure can protect an organization’s image and save an organization a lot of money.</li><BR>
<li>Hacking can lead to loss of business for organizations that deal in finance such as PayPal. Ethical hacking puts them a step ahead of the cyber criminals who would otherwise lead to loss of business.</li></ul><font><BR>
<h1>Legality of Ethical Hacking</h1>
<font size="4"><p>Ethical Hacking is legal if the hacker abides by the rules stipulated in the above section on the definition of ethical hacking. The International Council of E-Commerce Consultants (EC-Council) provides a certification program that tests individual’s skills. Those who pass the examination are awarded with certificates. The certificates are supposed to be renewed after some time.</p><font>


<h1>Summary</h1>
<font size="4"><ul>
<li>Hacking is identifying and exploiting weaknesses in computer systems and/or computer networks.</li><BR>
<li>Cybercrime is committing a crime with the aid of computers and information technology infrastructure.</li><BR>
<li>Ethical Hacking is about improving the security of computer systems and/or computer networks.</li><BR>
<li>Ethical Hacking is about improving the security of computer systems and/or computer networks.</li><BR>
